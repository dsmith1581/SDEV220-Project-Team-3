This program implements an inventory management system for departments across the Ivy Tech campuses. The application aims to accept CRUD style operations on entries as well as a way to search/filter the entered data in a friendly way all from a friendly GUI. Import/export to xlsx files to allow for long term management, inventories for multiple campuses, and backup/sharing of data are used.
